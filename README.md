# Python-Course

Python course work and examples covering fundamental to intermediate concepts.

## Course Overview

This repository contains my work and exercises from a Python programming course. It covers various Python concepts including:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modules
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- File handling
- Basic web development

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **OOP/**: Contains examples of Object-Oriented Programming in Python
  - `class.py`: Demonstrates class definitions and usage
  - `turtle.py`: Examples using Python's turtle graphics module

- **portfolio/**: A simple web portfolio project
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file
  - `style.css`: CSS styling for the portfolio

- **Basic Python Examples**:
  - `hello.py`: Simple "Hello World" program
  - `condition.py`: Examples of conditional statements
  - `loops.py`: Demonstrates different types of loops
  - `list.py`: Working with lists
  - `tuples.py`: Working with tuples
  - `slicing.py`: String and list slicing operations
  - `sort.py`: Sorting algorithms and methods

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of command line operations

### Running Python Files
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/musaCODEzz/Python-Course.git
   cd Python-Course
   ```

2. To run any Python file, use the following command:
   ```
   python filename.py
   ```
   
   For example:
   ```
   python hello.py
   ```

3. For the portfolio project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Learning Progress

This repository represents my journey learning Python, from basic concepts to more advanced topics. Each file demonstrates different aspects of Python programming that I've learned throughout the course.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning!
